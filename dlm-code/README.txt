This directory contains the DLM version of the mie_single routine.

See the README.txt in the top level directory for compilation instructions.

The DLM routine can be called in the same way as the normal mie_single routine:

mie_dlm_single, Dx, Cm, [Dqv=dqv], Dqxt, Dqsc, Dqbk, Dg, Xs1, Xs2, F11, F33,
                F12, F34

Dx must be a vector of type double (it can have one element though), Cm must be a
scaler of type double complex and Dqv (if it is specified) must be a vector of
type double (it can have one element though).
